#### Discussion of findings

**TODO**: include here a short description of findings (max. 3 sentences). If
you found opportunities for optimization, you can use more than 3 sentences to
describe what you found and how you optimized your code.

Sorts are very heavy specially with a lot of elements, so we removed any sort that we found unnecessary.
