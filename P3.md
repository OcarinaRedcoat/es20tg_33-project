#### Rationale
End-to-end tests are used to validate and ensure that all of the layers and components of the system application work properly giving the costumer the expected experience.
This increases the confidence in the application, and let's us reduce testing time and cost using testing tools (eg. Cypress).

### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Student creates a Tourney, gets the list, enrolls in it and deletes it](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_33-project/blob/6b608d3e511108312bc4e8630ebac551a8ae2d15/frontend/cypress/integration/student/tourneys.js#L16)

#### Rationale
The end-to-end tests ensure us that the tested features work as expected and fail when they are supposed to, since they test and validate all the layers of the application. They also test the application across various endpoints. which increases the confidence in it. And they also end up reducing testing cost and time if they are done by a testing tool like Cypress.
