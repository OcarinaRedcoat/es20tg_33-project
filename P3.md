### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Student creates a Tourney, gets the list, enrolls in it and deletes it](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_33-project/blob/6b608d3e511108312bc4e8630ebac551a8ae2d15/frontend/cypress/integration/student/tourneys.js#L16)

#### Rationale
The end-to-end tests ensure us that the tested features work as expected and fail when they are supposed to, since they test and validate all the layers of the application. They also test the application across various endpoints. which increases the confidence in it. And they also end up reducing testing cost and time if they are done by a testing tool like Cypress.
